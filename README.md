# Ender 5 Plus

I purchased a second hand 2021 Ender 5 Plus that was working "so-so" with the extruder motor installed on top of the hotend

**Current Ender 5 Plus mods:**
1. Installed Klipper via an external RPI zero 2
2. Replaced the original V2.2 board with a Creality 1.1.5 Silent Board.
  Made adapters for the dual Z-axis and fans
  The BL-Touch control pin is connected to ISCP interface with Vcc, MOSI (command signal of the BL-Touch), GND. The signal pin and GND have been inverted and connected to the Z-end.
3. Installed a Sprite Extruder Pro.
  Used the adapter from https://www.printables.com/model/329742-ender-5-plate-sprite-pro
  Reused the BL-Touch from the original extruder setup
4. Enabled original touchscreen with https://github.com/Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper as described here https://www.reddit.com/r/ender5plus/comments/kx9hsy/klipper_screen_on_ender_5_plus/ and as reference

And this video for the connections https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pZmeRf-XNs
  RxD_LCD -> PD2, TxD_LCD -> PD3

Current printer.cfg

**Future mods:**

4a. Finalise configuration for the original touschscreen with diplaying the Print Status https://github.com/Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper/wiki/Print-status

5. Install ADXL345 with connections to the RPI, twisted cables: GND+MISO, 3.3V+MOSI, SCLK+CS and setup input shaping
  Used V2 mount from https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/creality-sprite-adxl345-mount
  Got issues with enabling [mcu rpi] that I solved with section 2.6. od this tutorial and checked systemctl status klipper-mcu

7. 400mm MG12H Linear rails for Y: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3960105 or remix: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5380428
  with such end-stops: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3449917

8. Control of a smart power socket via moonraker and tinytuya (https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya) or https://github.com/teejo75/mtghs -> that should enable to get rid of octoprint on my ender3v2 and further install Klipper on this one
7. Install a ZeroPointModule (https://github.com/pkElectronics/ZeroPointModule) in order to have the RPI zero 2 inside the printer box with the 24V power supply from the printer. Maybe using this method for the serial connection: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNxE_v5G_bg
8. Command the always ON fan of the extruder and the always ON fan from the printer box via the PWMs of the ZeroPointModule
9. Move the BL-Touch to have no Y offset
10. Make a small PCB for the original touchscreen, the filament sensor and the BL-Touch on the original Creality 1.1.5 Board
   VCC                        GND
   N/A                        N/A
   N/A                        RxD_LCD -> PD2
   N/A                        TxD_LCD -> PD3
