# Ender5Plus

I purchased a second hand 2021 Ender 5 Plus that was not working with the extruder motor installed on top `

**Current Ender 5 Plus mods:**
1. Install Klipper via an RPI zero 2
2. Install a Creality 1.1.5 Silent Board
3. Install a Sprite Extruder Pro
  Use the adapter from https://www.printables.com/model/329742-ender-5-plate-sprite-pro
  Reuse the BL-Touch from the original extruder setup

Current printer.cfg

**Future mods:**
5. Get the original touch screen working with Klipper with https://github.com/Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper as described here 
6. Displace the BL-Touch as overheating and have a support for the ADXL345
